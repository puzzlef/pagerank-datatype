Comparison of PageRank using [float] vs [bfloat16] as the **storage type**
([pull], [CSR]).

This experiment was for comparing the result between:
1. Find pagerank using **float** as the storage type.
2. Find pagerank using **bfloat16** as the storage type.

Both datatypes were attempted on different types of graphs, running each
technique 5 times per graph to get a good time measure. Unfortunately it seems
**bfloat16** cannot be used for PageRank as its **too inaccurate** (atleast
when simply replacing *float* vectors with *bfloat16* vectors). Using [fp16]
might work, but likely give negligible performance improvement over float.
Note that neither approach makes use of *SIMD instructions* which are
available on all modern hardware.

All outputs are saved in [out](out/) and a small part of the output is listed
here. The input data used for this experiment is available at ["graphs"] (for
small ones), and the [SuiteSparse Matrix Collection]. This experiment was done
with guidance from [Prof. Dip Sankar Banerjee] and [Prof. Kishore Kothapalli].
