Performance of CUDA-based PageRank using **32-bit ints** vs **64-bit ints**
for the CSR representation ([pull], [CSR]).

This experiment was for comparing the performance between:
1. Find pagerank using *32-bit ints* (**int32**).
2. Find pagerank using *64-bit ints* (**int64**).

Both datatypes were attempted on different types of graphs, running each
technique 5 times per graph to get a good time measure. It seems using **int64**
datatype **increases execution time by 6-35%**, when compared to *int32*. With
respect to **GM-RATIO**, using *64-bit integer CSR representation* is **17%
slower** **(0.85x)** than using 32-bit integer CSR representation. With respect
to **AM-RATIO**, using *64-bit integer CSR representation* is **24% slower
(0.81x)**. This could be attributed to increased memory bandwidth requirement.
However, this overhead is somewhat small, despite the fact that most of the data
for a graph is actually associated with the CSR representation. As the CSR
representation is accessed linearly, improved memory coalescing might be the
*saviour* here.

All outputs are saved in [out](out/) and a small part of the output is listed
here. Some [charts] are also included below, generated from [sheets]. The input
data used for this experiment is available at ["graphs"] (for small ones), and
the [SuiteSparse Matrix Collection]. This experiment was done with guidance
from [Prof. Dip Sankar Banerjee] and [Prof. Kishore Kothapalli].
